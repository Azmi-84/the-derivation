**_the derivation_** is an educational platform that aims to connect the theoretical knowledge of **mechanics of machines** with practical applications through programming and numerical methods. Our mission is to empower learners to understand and implement complex mechanical concepts in a step-by-step and structured manner.

---

The resources of the platform are organized into a couple of sections:

<!-- - [About](source/about.md)
- [Mechanisms](source/mechanisms/mechanisms.md)
  - [Slider Crank Mechanism](source/mechanisms/slider_crank_mechanism/theory/fundamentals.md) -->
